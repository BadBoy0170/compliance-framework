# Compliance Framework

This project is a Compliance Framework application designed to streamline and automate the process of IT Risk Compliance reporting. It provides a centralized platform for generating, managing, and analyzing compliance reports, helping organizations maintain regulatory adherence and mitigate risks effectively.

I developed this project out of a personal need to simplify complex compliance workflows. Existing solutions often felt cumbersome and lacked the flexibility required for dynamic IT environments. My goal was to create an intuitive and efficient tool that not only automates report generation but also provides clear insights into compliance posture, ultimately saving time and reducing manual effort for IT professionals and auditors.
